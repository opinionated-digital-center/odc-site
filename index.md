Check our [About](/about/) page to find out more about the center's aim, how we try
to reach it and how we organised our resources (other than the posts and articles
on this website).

## Resources list

* [Organisation-wide Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) repository](https://github.com/opinionated-digital-center/architecture-decision-records).
* [PyADR](https://github.com/opinionated-digital-center/pyadr), a CLI to help with our
  ADR lifecycle process.
* [Python Library Project Template](https://github.com/opinionated-digital-center/python-library-project-generator),
  a fully tested, feature rich [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter/)
  scaffold to kick start your Python library and command line interface development
  (including CI/CD pipelines and automated publishing).
* [Behave4cli](https://gitlab.com/opinionated-digital-center/behave4cli/) (soon to be
  transfered to GitHub), an extension (testing domain) of
  [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io) to test commands and
  command-line interfaces (console apps).
* [Behave4git](https://github.com/opinionated-digital-center/behave4git), an extension
  (testing domain) of [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io)
  to use Git and GitLab (and GitHub in the near future).

Planned addition (stay tuned):
* A Big Data Project Template.
